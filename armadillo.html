        Armadillos are small, armored mammals known for their protective shells made of bony plates. 
        They are primarily found in the Americas, with the nine-banded armadillo being the most common 
        species in the United States. These nocturnal creatures have strong claws that help them dig 
        for insects, their primary food source. Despite their tough exterior, armadillos are surprisingly 
        agile and can even jump when startled. Some species can roll into a ball to defend themselves from 
        predators, making them one of natureâ€™s most unique animals.
